# Writing deployment script

Before we start writing any deployment module, make sure that you have
tackled [intermediate](../tutorial/intermediate.md) or atleast [basic](../tutorial/basic.md) tutorial. This way it would
be much easier for you to grasp how the whole workflow is operating.

## Automated

You can use next command for the start:

```
hardhat-ignition tutorial
```

This command should help you to set up initial deployment script and after you can continue writing alone after you
understood the basics of deployment script.
